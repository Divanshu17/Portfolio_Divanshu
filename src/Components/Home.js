          <p>
            I am passionate about transforming raw ideas into fully functional websites and applications that make a difference. The process of creating something meaningful that can impact people's lives excites me, and I strive to work on projects that challenge me as a developer and make me proud.<br/><br/>
            I am fluent in <b>C++</b> and have a working knowledge of <b>Python</b>. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into the <b>MERN stack</b> by working on various projects that enhance my full-stack development skills.<br/><br/>
            In the near future, I plan to learn <b>Next.js</b>, <b>Three.js</b>, and <b>TypeScript</b> to further expand my expertise and take on more complex projects.<br/><br/>
            Apart from coding, I have a deep interest in <b>photography</b>, and I love capturing the beauty of the world through my lens. You can check out some of my photography work on my Instagram.
